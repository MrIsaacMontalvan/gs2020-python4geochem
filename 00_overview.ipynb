    "## Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "While the geochemistry community is transitioning to more open, reproducible and collaborative science practices, effective tools to facilitate this transition remain few in number. Here we describe a number of geochemistry-focused open source Python packages at various stages of development, and highlight some of the software development practises and tools we have used to build them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these, the most advanced is pyrolite, a Python package built to facilitate data-driven understanding of geological processes using multivariate geochemical data. The core features of this package include functions for transforming geochemical data and visualisation (including ternary, spider and density diagrams). Other under-development tools include utilities for transformation of image and stage coordinates to allow reproducible positioning between instruments, a simple tool for predicting molecular ion interferences from and a pyrolite extension linking compositions to alphaMELTS models. Each of these software projects are co-developed with their documentation and integrated test suites. Online documentation is updated and versioned with the software, and includes a set of examples for key features.\n",
    "These tools are developed for and by the geochemistry community, and are both freely available and released under an unrestrictive license. Questions and all forms of user contributions are welcomed (e.g. code, documentation, bug reports and feature requests). We hope these tools will contribute to enabling better geochemical research practices, and potentially even establishing common workflows for geochemical data processing and analysis within the user community.\n",
    "\n",
    "A programmatic approach has distinct advantages over spreadsheet-based tools, and can result in improved transparency and traceability of results. The scientific Python ecosystem provides a solid foundation for prototyping, developing and interlinking tools from data processing through to modelling and machine learning. Tools can be extended with user interfaces and optimised for performance where needed. Where accessibility is kept in mind, developing tools in Python, and designing packages to be re-used and integrated into existing scientific workflows can improve efficiency and reproducibility while enabling geoscientists to develop transferable digital skills."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This presentation includes a brief discussion around challenges for developing research software for geochemistry, notes around a suite of tools and services which can be used to develop open source software (as done here), and also a series of examples which provide high-level overviews and demonstrations for recently developed geochemistry-focused Python packages. Note that this presentation will remain available after the conference, and is archived on Zenodo for reference. Small changes and additions may be made to this repository over time to keep it up to date and fix any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those here principally for the examples, have a quick read of the key messages below, and feel free to skip ahead!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Software is a key part of geochemical research\n",
    "* Existing software is often relatively inflexible and intransparent\n",
    "* Developing open-source tools can address some of the existing challenges\n",
    "* Community input and support is likely required to make this sustainable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software in Geochemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "While software was once auxiliary to the collection of data and generation of knowledge, it is quickly becoming an essential component of scientific research. In geochemical research, we use software<sup><a id=\"a1\">[*](#f1)</a></sup> to control instruments and collect data, to reduce this raw data to produce estimates of composition, to analyze and model our data, and to produce graphical representations which we can use to communicate the meaning and significance of all of this. Additionally, while it's not the focus of this presentation, research software can also be later tertiary education programs, especially those which seek to introduce students to what research looks like in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "With regard to mass-spectrometry, software for data collection is often specific to individual instruments and in most cases proprietary, but tools for data analysis and visualization can vary widely. Particularly in this space, there's opportunities to develop specialized tools to enhance and add value geochemical research outputs, and potentially get more out of our data. In particular, specifically designing software for transparency, reproducibility and accessibility will aid the interpretability of results and data reuse. In this presentation we make the case for developing tools for geochemical research with Python<sup><a id=\"a2\">[†](#f2)</a></sup>, and in the open - ideally with contribution from a community of users. \n",
    "\n",
    "While it's not always the first option, developing your own software may be a productive path if you're frequently having issues wrangling with inflexible (and sometimes, expensive) software which doesn't meet your need. With some planning and design, It is also a way to add value to research already being conducted, bring interoperability and standardization and contribute to the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>\n",
    "<p>   \n",
    "<b id=\"f1\">*</b>: Here where we refer to software, we are purposely using the term in a relatively broad sense, and intend to refer to the range of software-based tools which are used in geochemistry (i.e. everything from templated excel spreadsheets to ecosystems of related professionally-developed standalone executable programs). \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b id=\"f2\">†</b>: Note that while this presentation focuses on Python, it is largely for reasons of convenience rather than in support of it’s exclusive use. There are a number of languages which fit well with the ideas presented here and are approachable for those new to coding, notably including R and Julia.\n",
    "</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements and Challenges for Research Software\n",
    "\n",
    "There are number of key challenges for the development, adoption and sustainability of research software projects. Below we've listed a few of them with assocaited questions, and some potential solutions or advantages in developing community-driven open-source software.\n",
    "\n",
    "<dl>\n",
    "<dt><b>Development and Maintenance</b></dt>\n",
    "<dd><em>Do I have the skills to develop this? Can we sustainability develop and maintain this?</em></dd>\n",
    "    \n",
    "One relatively flexible way of making tools available for use is through developing modular libraries or packages, which can be used as components in other software (which may, for example, add an additional user interface). By constructing modular software, not only can we focus on the core components we need and use for research, but we can build and version individual components separately.\n",
    "    \n",
    "By developing tools in high-level languages (e.g. Python, R, Julia) which do not need to be compiled, some of the complexity of learning and starting to write code is avoided. This allows researchers to relatively quickly build something which works, which can be further developed into a prototype or package.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<dt><b>Trust and Transparency</b></dt>\n",
    "<dd><em>How do I know this does what I expect? How do I know if this is a bug?</em></dd>\n",
    "\n",
    "Being open-source allows others to interrogate and debug a code base to understand how it works, and potentially contribute to bugfixes and patches where issues are identified.\n",
    "    \n",
    "A suite of automated tests which cover most of the code base can be used to demonstrate that most things are working as expected (at least for the expected use cases).\n",
    "    \n",
    "By attributing versions to successive releases, a consistent reference point is established for the identification of issues (e.g. \"there's a bug with plot colors in v1.2.0, but it was fixed for v1.2.1\"). A changelog is a useful addition to the documentation which effectively describes how the software evolves, at at which issues are identified and fixed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "One key advantage of building these tools at a community level, or at least in interaction with the community, is that outcomes of discussions around best-practice can be integrated into tools as defaults (and hence available without any additional effort from the user).\n",
    "    \n",
    "<dt><b>Accessibility and Documentation</b></dt>\n",
    "<dd><em>How do I install this? Can I contribute? Does it work on my operating system? How do I do X?</em></dd>\n",
    "\n",
    "Packaging code and publishing it in public repositories (e.g. PyPI for Python) allows for relatively straightforward installation. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Documentation is a key facilitator for adoption of software, and will also typically help with sustainable maintenance and development.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Developing modular packages in e.g. Python reduces changes of operating-system dependencies. Adding automated test suites which are run on multiple systems allows users more certainty around what potential issues might exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "<dt><b>Governance</b></dt>\n",
    "<dd><em>Who should have oversight? How do we encourage all parts of our community to contribute?</em></dd>\n",
    "    \n",
    "This is perhaps the key challenge for open-source projects, especially those developed by researchers. Typically a project has a single maintainer, and potentially a number of contributors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<dt><b>Recognition</b></dt>\n",
    "<dd><em>How do we assure that researchers, developers and technicians receive attribution/credit for this work?</em></dd>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this work to be sustainable, those developing research software should receive appropriate recognition and have the opportunity to develop ongoing careers - but the commonly used metrics in academic research don't necessarily translate well for software. \n",
    "    \n",
    "While there are efforts towards increased software citation, there are open questions around how e.g. maintenance is recognized.\n",

    "\n",
    "The scientific Python ecosystem is large and relatively mature; a wide variety of numerical, visualization and utility packages exist which make for a solid foundation from which to build more specialized tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "``pyrolite`` and related tools are built upon already-existing and widely used tools for working with tabular data (e.g. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)<sup><a href='#mckinney'>[1]</a></sup>) and visualization (e.g. [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)<sup><a href='#hunter'>[2]</a></sup>). As a result generally follows their conventions and syntax, and also exposes exposes their API such that it can be readily accessed. In particular, the API makes use of dataframe accessor classes provided by ``pandas`` to add additional dataframe 'namespaces' (e.g. accessing the ``pyrolite`` spiderplot method via `df.pyroplot.spider()`). This approach allows ``pyrolite`` to use more familiar syntax, helping geochemists new to Python to hit the ground running, and encouraging development of transferable knowledge and skills.\n",

These projects use a ['gitflow' workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) to incorporate new changes into the next release. Once releases are generated, the repository is packaged and uploaded to the Python Package Index, [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), and typically an archive is created on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), which then receives a DOI such that each version is readily citable."

For general chat, questions and debugging, we use [Gitter](https://gitter.im) (e.g. see the [channel for ``pyrolite``](https://gitter.im/pyrolite/community)), which nicely links to Issues and Pull Requests on GitHub for reference. This essentially serves as a searchable forum space, such that we can easily identify questions which appear repeatedly and improve the related documentation. GitHub serves as the centre of development activity for the project. It hosts an Issues board (for identifying bugs and issues, as well as requesting or discussing new features), and provides a foundation on which we can incorporate community contributions (e.g. via pull-request).\n",
    "\n",
    "Community contributions to help develop these projects into useful toolkits and resources are welcomed and encouraged (for both research and education purposes). Information regarding contributions (of various flavours, from bug reports and documentation through to code contributions or even whole features) are presented on the documentation websites (e.g. [pyrolite's](https://pyrolite.readthedocs.io/en/master/dev/contributing.html)), along with a list of contributors and a Code of Conduct (which applies across the project generally; [see here](https://pyrolite.readthedocs.io/en/master/dev/conduct.html)).\n",

    "\n",
    "While we're all currently moving towards more digital approaches to our research, it would seem an opportune time to combine efforts and reduce potentially duplicated work through collaborative development of shared tools. Not only can we work towards improved standardisation and interoperatiblity, but we can incorporate best practises and modern data analysis tools into our software such that we make the most of our data. In an ideal world, a shared effort here might mean we can spend more of our time and money on the actual research, instrument maintenance, supporting technicians and researchers - but that may be a touch optimistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "There remain a variety of challenges to developing software in a research context, and while the solutions to some technical issues are often readily solved, challenges related to the community and developers will remain for some time. Software needs to be maintained to be sustained and to remain useful, and this is relatively human intensive (lest we be left with more bugs, less functional software and legacy issues). Approaching and discussing these challenges proactively would be a worthy investment to make such efforts more sustainable."
